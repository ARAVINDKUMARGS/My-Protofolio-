# My Portfolio

A clean, mobile-friendly personal portfolio template built with plain HTML & CSS — ready to edit on your phone and deploy on Vercel.

> Quick: edit `index.html` and `style.css` in Acode (or any mobile code editor), push to GitHub, then import the repo on Vercel to go live.

---

## What’s inside
- `index.html` — main page (placeholders ready for your name, about, projects, contact, etc.)
- `style.css`  — styles & mobile-friendly layout
- `README.md`  — (this file)
- `.gitignore` — optional (recommended to add if you include build files later)

---

## How to customize (mobile-friendly)
1. Install **Acode** (or any file editor) on your phone.  
2. Open the `index.html` file and replace placeholder comments like `<!-- Your Name -->` with your details.  
3. Edit colors, fonts or spacing in `style.css` if you want a different look.  
4. Save files.

## How to push to GitHub (using GitHub mobile app)
1. Open **GitHub** app → tap **+** → **New repository** → name it (e.g., `portfolio`) → create.  
2. Open the repo → tap **Add file** → **Create new file** → paste the contents of `index.html` → commit.  
3. Repeat for `style.css` and `README.md`.  
> Tip: You can also upload files directly from Acode (Export → Upload to GitHub) if the editor supports it.

---

## Deploy on Vercel (mobile)
1. Open your phone browser and go to **vercel.com** (or use Vercel app).  
2. Sign in with **GitHub**.  
3. Click **New Project** → import your `portfolio` repo → **Deploy**.  
4. After deploy, Vercel gives you a live URL like `https://your-repo-name.vercel.app`. Share it!

## Optional — Use Git (if you prefer terminal on phone)
If you have Termux / a terminal that supports Git:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/<your-repo>.git
# edit files locally with your editor
git add .
git commit -m "Initial portfolio"
git push origin main
